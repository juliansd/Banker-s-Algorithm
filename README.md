README.md

This project focuses on implementing a discrete simulation of FIFO and Banker's Algorith which are algorithms used in resource allocation for tasks.

The project conists of two classes, Main and Task.

## Main
This class runs the main functionality of the project. It implements the discrete simulation for FIFO and Banker's Algorithm and handles the processing of the input.

## Task
This class represents the tasks that are being maniuplated by the discrete simulation in Main.
